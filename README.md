# Case System for Raspberry Pi or other (e.g. Stellarmate and Astroberry on Raspberry or Thin Client PC)

Hi there,

this is a 3D printable case system to build a astro pc made of a raspberry pi. It uses custom V-shaped conectors that are strong enough an easylily interchangable

For THIS PROJECT, you only need the following screws and glue:
- M3/36mm
- M2/12mm
- glue: I recommend Pattex Stabilit Express 2K or super glue)

I am printing the Vixen-style connectors with PLA  (Polymaker Polymax) an the housing parts with PC (Polymaker PC) due to temperature resistance. 
Everything always with 100% infill (you can use cubic infill with 50% but might get trouble.


# Additions:
## AZ-EQ-6 mount 
No screws. Glue together with long v-mount.

## Lenovo Think Centre M93P thin client mount
Uses M3x12. Glue together with long v-mount (bottom) and short v-mount on top.

## My screws for my 3D printing projects
For all my 3D printig projects I am am using only the following screws (you do not need them all here). This has been proven to be good enough. Don't by them peace by peace! Minimum quantities of 50 or 100 will be as costly as a couple single ones. And you will need them for a lot of project

## My Stellarmate
- This design is currently for a RPI 4B (not 3, not 5)
- I currently build this for use it with
 - Geekworm NVME hat (via USB) for Raspberry Pi 4 - X862 V2.0
 - Geekworm Raspberry Pi 4 Model B passive heat sink
 - Geekworm X735 V3.0 power hat (https://wiki.geekworm.com/X735) for a stable power supply for the Pi4. I can use any input from 5V (USB-C, MIcro-USB) to 6-30V DC (via a round 5.1 mm jack).
 - More to come: a PiFinder hat
